This is the directory for the first lab.

The aim of the lab is to write a simplified shell that can support basic commands and multi-pipes commands

The detailed information can be found in Assignment.pdf, and the Skeleton_code.c is the basic code file offered by the TA

My implementation is in myshell.c, to run it, do 

```shell
gcc -o myshell myshell.c
```

```shell
./myshell
```
